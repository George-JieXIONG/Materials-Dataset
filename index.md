## Welcome to Materials Dataset 

This webpage is developed based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and maintain by [Dr. XIONG Jie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jie-Xiong-8).

The datasets are related to metallic materials including steels, metallic glasses, and high entropy alloys



### The Steels Dataset

All data are colleted from [NIMS database](https://mits.nims.go.jp/en/), and details see [steel dataset](https://github.com/George-JieXIONG/Materials-Dataset/blob/main/Chapter4/NIMS-Fatigue.csv) 

```markdown

This dataset contains 360 data samples comprised 16 variables of nine alloying elements, one reduction ratio, three heat-treatment temperatures, three inclusions and four target properties (fatigue strength, tensile strength, fracture strength, and hardness) of steels. 

```

For more detailes see the Article [Machine learning of mechanical properties of steels](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11431-020-1599-5.pdf)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/George-JieXIONG/Materials-Dataset/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
